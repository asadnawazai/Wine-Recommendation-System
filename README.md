# Wine Recommendation System

This project is a **Wine Recommendation System** that suggests wines to customers based on the food they select. The project is built using **Django** for the web interface, while the machine learning model used for recommendations was trained in **Jupyter Notebook**. The system is designed to offer a user-friendly interface for food and wine pairing, helping users to get the best-suited wine recommendations.


## Project Overview
The **Wine Recommendation System** provides wine suggestions based on the food input provided by users. The recommendation is generated through a machine learning model trained on a dataset of food and wine pairings. Users can select a food item through the web interface, and the system suggests wines that pair well with the chosen food.

This project demonstrates the integration of machine learning with a web framework for real-world applications. The machine learning model was developed and trained in a **Jupyter Notebook**, and the web interface was created using **Django**.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: Core programming language for both backend and machine learning model.
- **Django**: Framework for developing the web application.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: Used for data analysis and model training.
- **scikit-learn**: For machine learning model development.
- **SQLite**: Default database for Django (can be replaced with PostgreSQL or MySQL).
- **HTML/CSS**: For creating a basic, user-friendly UI.
- **Bootstrap** (optional): For styling and making the UI responsive.

## Features
- **User Input via UI**: Customers can select the type of food they are having via a dropdown menu.
- **Wine Recommendation**: Based on the selected food, the system provides a list of recommended wines.
- **Machine Learning**: The recommendation engine is powered by a machine learning model that was trained on a dataset of food and wine pairings.
- **Scalable**: Easily extendable to include more wines, foods, and additional features like wine filters.
